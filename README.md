# Getting started

The open-source Amplify Framework provides the following products to build fullstack iOS, Android, Flutter, Web, and React Native apps:

    Amplify CLI - Configure all the services needed to power your backend through a simple command line interface.
    Amplify Libraries - Use case-centric client libraries to integrate your app code with a backend using declarative interfaces.
    Amplify UI Components - UI libraries for React, React Native, Angular, Ionic, Vue and Flutter.

The Amplify Console is an AWS service that provides a git-based workflow for continuous deployment & hosting of fullstack web apps. Cloud resources created by the Amplify CLI are also visible in the Amplify Console.

# What we'll build

This tutorial guides you through setting up a backend and integrating that backend with your web app. You will create a fully featured Todo app using Amplify DataStore to store and retrieve items in a cloud database, as well as receive updates over a realtime subscription.

What you will do:

    Set up a Flutter application configured with Amplify
    Create a data model and persist data to Amplify DataStore
    Connect your local data to synchronize to a cloud backend
